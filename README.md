Detecting market regimes is a valuable application in finance and economics. The primary purpose of a project focused on market regime detection is to identify and categorize different phases or states of the financial markets over time. Market regimes can be characterized by distinct behaviors, trends, and volatilities, and understanding these regimes can inform trading and investment decisions. In this project, we apply several approaches to identify market regimes using VNIndex historical data.
